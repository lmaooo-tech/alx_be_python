"""
For this task, you are to write a Python script that calculates the area of a rectangle. The area of a rectangle is found by multiplying its length by its width.

Instructions:

Create a file named rectangle_area.py.
Define two variables in this file:
length with a value representing the length of the rectangle.
width with a value representing the width of the rectangle.
For simplicity, let’s use length = 10 and width = 5.
Calculate the area of the rectangle using the formula (Area = length × width) and store the result in a variable named area.
Print the calculated area in a format: The area of the rectangle is: [area].
"""
#define variables 
length = 10
width = 5

#calculate the area of the rectangle
area = length * width 

#print the results 
print(f"The are of the rectangle is: {area}")
